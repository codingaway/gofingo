| Category             | Patterns                | Description |
|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| Creational Patterns  | [Abstract Factory](creational/abstractfactory)       |  The abstract factory pattern is used to provide a client with a set of related or dependant objects. The "family" of objects created by the factory are determined at run-time.           |
|                      | Builder                 |             |
|                      | [Factory Method](creational/factorymethod)          | The factory pattern is used to replace class constructors, abstracting the process of object generation so that the type of the object instantiated can be determined at run-time.            |
|                      | Prototype               |             |
|                      | Singleton               |             |
| Structural Patterns  | Adapter                 |             |
|                      | Bridge                  |             |
|                      | Composite               |             |
|                      | Decorator               |             |
|                      | Facade                  |             |
|                      | Flyweight               |             |
|                      | Proxy                   |             |
| Behavioural Patterns | Chain of Responsibility |             |
|                      | Command                 |             |
|                      | Interpreter             |             |
|                      | Iterator                |             |
|                      | Mediator                |             |
|                      | Memento                 |             |
|                      | Observer                |             |
|                      | State                   |             |
|                      | Strategy                |             |
|                      | Template Method         |             |
|                      | Visitor                 |             |
